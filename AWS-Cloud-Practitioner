Cloud computing: Ondemand delivery of computing Services Eg: Computers, Databases, applications and other IT resources
Cloud Deployment models: Private,Public and Hybrid(public + Private (company owned infrastucture))
Types of cloud computing: 
1) IAAS (Infrastructure as a Code)
    -Getting networking, Computers, Data storage space from cloud
2) PAAS (Platform as a service)
    -Deploying our applications on cloud 
3) SAAS (Software as a service)
    -Getting softwares from cloud they are managed by cloud. example version upgrades etc

Region: Is a Location that has one or more availaility Zones.
     -In a Region we have 3 to 6 availaility Zones.
Availability Zones: Is a collection of one or more discrete data centres.
     -They are separated from each other so that are isolated from disaster
Now we can say Region is a collection of cluster of datacentres

*)IAM : Identity Access Management
----------------------------------
Its a global service
Root user is created by default shouldn't be used or shared
Users - people in the organization can be grouped
Group - only contain users not other groups

Users can belong to multiple groups, Users can also be not part of any groups

Policy: Its a json document to provide permissions to Users or groups for aws services 
SC: Policy is assigned to Users or Groups to provide permissions
Eg: admin, IAMReadonlyaccess

IAM Role: will provide permissions to AWS resources to access other resources in aws or to perform tasks in this aws account or other aws accounts.
Eg: Ec2Instance roles, LambdaFunction Roles
SC: Policy provide permissions for users, IAM Role provides permissions to AWS Services/resources to do any task in aws

Number of ways to access AWS
1) AWS Management console : You can access all the resource of AWS here.
2) AWS CLI: Using Access Keys
3) AWS SDK: to access api's in the application code. accessed by AccessK Keys

*)EC2: Elastic Cloud Compute
-Its a computer (linux,Windows,Mac)
-t2.micro is an image with 1VCPU, 1GB RAM, 
-Bootstrapping scripts or Ec2 User Data Scripts - A script used to install softwares, do any tasks at the time of Ec2 creation. This script run only once at the time of creation.
-You can start /Stop/Terminate resources to less the cost
-EBS : Its like Hard Disk (Elastic Block Storage)

Ports:
------
22 - SSH - login to linux machine
21- FTP -Upload files to file share
22 - SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - Upload files using SSH
80 - HTTP -Access unsecured Websites
443 - HTTPS - access Secured websites
3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) -Login to windows instances
1433 - sql port


*)Security Groups: 
-Controls how traffic is allowed into or out of AWS resources
-Acts like Firewall
-They only contain allow rules
-Rules can be referenced by IP or security Group
-Region specific. If you changete region then this security group wont be available there.

AWS services
-------------
*)Ec2: Elastic cloud Computing : like our computers

*)EBS: Elastic block storage : we will attach storage to the Ec2. They are network drives.like D drive storage,E drive storage
- EBS volumes are bound to availability zones. you cannot attach an ebs of us-east to us-west.where Ec2 is in us-east
- We can detatch and attach to another instance very quickly
