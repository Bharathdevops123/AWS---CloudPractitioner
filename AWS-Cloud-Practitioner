Udemy: [NEW] Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 2025

Free account - For 1 year

Cloud computing: Ondemand delivery of computing Services Eg: Computers, Databases, applications and other IT resources
Cloud Deployment models: Private,Public and Hybrid(public + Private (company owned infrastucture))
Types of cloud computing: 
1) IAAS (Infrastructure as a Code)
    -Getting networking, Computers, Data storage space from cloud
2) PAAS (Platform as a service)
    -Deploying our applications on cloud 
3) SAAS (Software as a service)
    -Getting softwares from cloud they are managed by cloud. example version upgrades etc

Region: Is a Location that has one or more availaility Zones.
     -In a Region we have 3 to 6 availaility Zones.
Availability Zones: Is a collection of one or more discrete data centres.
     -They are separated from each other so that are isolated from disaster
Now we can say Region is a collection of cluster of datacentres

*)IAM : Identity Access Management
----------------------------------
Its a global service
Root user is created by default shouldn't be used or shared
Users - people in the organization can be grouped
Group - only contain users not other groups

Users can belong to multiple groups, Users can also be not part of any groups

Policy: Its a json document to provide permissions to Users or groups for aws services 
SC: Policy is assigned to Users or Groups to provide permissions
Eg: admin, IAMReadonlyaccess

IAM Role: will provide permissions to AWS resources to access other resources in aws or to perform tasks in this aws account or other aws accounts.
Eg: Ec2Instance roles, LambdaFunction Roles
SC: Policy provide permissions for users, IAM Role provides permissions to AWS Services/resources to do any task in aws

Number of ways to access AWS
1) AWS Management console : You can access all the resource of AWS here.
2) AWS CLI: Using Access Keys
3) AWS SDK: to access api's in the application code. accessed by AccessK Keys

*)EC2: Elastic Cloud Compute
-Its a computer (linux,Windows,Mac)
-t2.micro is an image with 1VCPU, 1GB RAM, 
-Bootstrapping scripts or Ec2 User Data Scripts - A script used to install softwares, do any tasks at the time of Ec2 creation. This script run only once at the time of creation.
-You can start /Stop/Terminate resources to less the cost
-EBS : Its like Hard Disk (Elastic Block Storage)

Ports:
------
22 - SSH - login to linux machine
21- FTP -Upload files to file share
22 - SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - Upload files using SSH
80 - HTTP -Access unsecured Websites
443 - HTTPS - access Secured websites
3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) -Login to windows instances
1433 - sql port


*)Security Groups: 
-Controls how traffic is allowed into or out of AWS resources
-Acts like Firewall
-They only contain allow rules
-Rules can be referenced by IP or security Group
-Region specific. If you change the region then this security group wont be available there.

AWS services
-------------
*)Ec2: Elastic cloud Computing : like our computers

*)EBS: Elastic block storage : we will attach storage to the Ec2. They are network drives.like D drive storage,E drive storage
- EBS volumes are bound to availability zones. you cannot attach an ebs of us-east to us-west.where Ec2 is in us-east
- We can detatch and attach to another instance very quickly
Snapshot is a copy of an Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Storage) volume.
AMI: Amazon Machine Image
Amazon produces few AMI's : public AMI
we can also create our own AMI and do our own customization of Ec2 instance. own OS, software, configuration, monitoring etc
AWS Market place AMI: Some body created it and sells at market place

*) Ec2 Image Builder: Using this we can create image of Ec2 instance and add softwares to it and we can test it and create 100s of Ec2 instance

*) EFS: Elastic File system
Its Managed Network file system.
Can be mounted to 100's of LINUX instances
Can be in any Avaliability Zones
Limited to only Linux instances

*) Fsx 
3rd party high performace computing

Scalability: Adding resources to the application/system to handle the Load
Types: 
Vertical Scalbilty: Increasing the size of the resource (Example increase the size of database, increase t2.micro to t2.large instance)
 -Scale up : Increase the size
 -Scale down: Decrease the size
Horizontal Scalability: Increasing no of resources ()
 -Scale out: Increase the resources
 -Scale in: Decrease the resources

High Availabilty: Running your application /system in at least 2 availability Zones. 
Our application will be available if one datacentre goes down or at any disaster

Load Balancer: distributes loads to ultiple servers equally.
4 types of Load balancer
1) Application Load balancer (Http,HTTPS only) - Layer 7
users -->ALB--> (Application on multiple servers)
2) Network Load balancer (Ultra high performance, allows for TCP ) -Layer 4
users -->NLB--> (Application on multiple servers) -- This is basically used when we need high performance when there is a need of transfer millions of transactions per second in an application
3) Gateway Load balancer - Layer 3
users -->GWLB--> (security security cheeck app) --> (Application on multiple servers)
4) Classic Load balancer (Retired in 2023)
